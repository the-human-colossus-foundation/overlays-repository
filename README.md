# Overlays Repository

Welcome to the **Overlays Repository** â€“ a community-driven effort to build and share task-specific overlays for the **[Overlays Capture Architecture](https://oca.colossi.network) (OCA)**. This repository enables contributors to create, share, and discover overlays that extend and enhance the functionality of Capture Bases and other Overlays.

## What is an Overlay?

Overlays are cryptographically linked objects that provide task-oriented definitional or contextual information to a **Capture Base** or other **Overlays**. These overlays enable users to:

- **Enhance Data with Metadata** â€“ Attach additional descriptive, contextual, or structured information to underlying objects.
- **Define Business Logic** â€“ Implement rules and conditions that influence the behavior of a system interacting with the overlay.
- **Customize Data Presentation** â€“ Structure how data is formatted, displayed, and interpreted for different audiences.
- **Transform User Experience** â€“ Modify and enrich how information is visually and functionally presented to viewers.
- **Automate Processes** â€“ Guide automated agents by defining workflows, actions, or decision-making parameters.
- and more ...

Overlays allow for flexible and structured data enhancement while maintaining a consistent foundation. They play a crucial role in extending the utility of the **Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)**.

## Contributing to the Overlays Repository

We welcome and encourage contributions from the community. Follow the steps below to create and submit your overlay.

### 0. Check for Existing Overlays

Before creating a new overlay, check if a similar idea already exists. If an existing overlay addresses the same need, consider improving or extending it instead of creating a new one.
The latest list of overlays can be found [here](/overlays.md)
### 1. Define the Purpose
Clearly define the **goal** of the overlay. Each overlay should serve a **single purpose** and should be focused on solving a **specific** problem.

### 2. Describe the Use Case
Provide a detailed **use case** explaining:
- Where and why the overlay is helpful.
- The scope and intended usage.
- Any relevant contextual framing.
- How the overlay may link to and interact with other overlays to enhance functionality.

This description helps others understand the overlayâ€™s **purpose and potential applications**.

### 3. Create an Example using OCAFILE Syntax
Develop an example using the **[OCAFILE](https://oca.colossi.network/ecosystem/ocafile.html)** syntax that demonstrates the overlay in action.

### 4. Develop a Template
Follow the [standard template](/template.md) structure to ensure consistency across all overlays. Templates help maintain clarity and usability.

### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
Push your overlay to this repository by creating a **Pull Request (PR)**. Ensure your submission adheres to repository [guidelines](/guidelines.md).
